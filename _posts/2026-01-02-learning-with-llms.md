By now, on and off, I have been using LLMs to learn new things. I have also observed how students, without guided instruction, attempt to use ChatGPT (and similar LLM-powered chatbots) as a tutor, as an answer source, as a learning aid.

From the perspective of a teacher, AI tutors are a fascinating specimen: they know so much, and at the same time they have such a long way to go. At this point I think I have enough anecdata to describe some of the flaws, and how astute learners can work around them to still extract immense learning value. 

Prof. Pratschke [described the responses of tech companies responding to the needs of learners as being “pedagogically uninformed”](). What this means is that OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI chat providers, when they add a “learning mode” to their chat offering, essentially give it a different system prompt—a different set of starting instructions.
