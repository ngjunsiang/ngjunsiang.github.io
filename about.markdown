Hi, Iâ€™m JS! In my job, I teach Computing at high school level in a junior college in Singapore. All the time, Iâ€™m exploring how we learn and know what we know, and how we teach it to others.

### Things Iâ€™m working on

(links to come!)

- intro-to-python, programming-in-python: self-guided courses for learning Python and programming patterns
- open-dis-python: contributing to the Python implementation of the DIS 7 (IEEE-1278.1) protocol [status: ongoing]
- TimelineBot: A telegram bot to help me automate my current ~~todo~~ done-list system
- Pseudo (working title): a code editor for (Cambridge 9618) pseudocode
- Scrollback (working title): an ORM for representing changes to a spreadsheet as an event stream, to enable time-aware search
- Laymanâ€™s Guide to Computing: a newsletter introducing Computing concepts in layperson language [status: in maintenance]

### Current obsessions

- **Capstone project:** a project my students undertake at senior year to demonstrate everything they have learnt
- **Remote collaboration:** is this a teachable skill or a learnable perspective? Yes. How do we inculcate a collaborative mindset in students
- **Increasing agency:** building systems that increase agency and autonomy in students
