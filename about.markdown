        Hi, Iâ€™m JS! In my job, I teach Computing at high school level in a junior college in Singapore. All the time, Iâ€™m exploring how we learn and know what we know, and how we teach it to others.

### Things Iâ€™m working on

(links to come!)

- [intro-to-python](https://github.com/nyjc-computing/intro-to-python), [programming-in-python](https://github.com/nyjc-computing/programming-in-python): self-guided courses for learning Python and programming patterns
- [open-dis-python](https://github.com/open-dis/open-dis-python): contributing to the Python implementation of the [DIS version 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Interactive_Simulation) (IEEE-1278.1) protocol [status: ongoing]
- TimelineBot (WIP): A telegram bot to help me automate my current ~~todo~~ done-list system
- Pseudo (working title): a code editor for (Cambridge 9618) pseudocode
- Scrollback (working title): an ORM for representing changes to a spreadsheet as an event stream, to enable time-aware search
- [Laymanâ€™s Guide to Computing](https://buttondown.com/laymansguide): a (dormant) newsletter introducing Computing concepts in layperson language; [archived version](/laymansguide/) [status: in maintenance]

### Current obsessions

- **Capstone project:** a project my students undertake at senior year to demonstrate everything they have learnt
- **Remote collaboration:** is this a teachable skill or a learnable perspective? Yes. How do we inculcate a collaborative mindset in students
- **Increasing agency:** building systems that increase agency and autonomy in students
